1. Even or Odd Check:

Use the modulus operator % to determine if a number is divisible by 2.

2. Prime Check:

Check divisibility from 2 up to the number itself (or up to its square root for optimization).

Handle edge cases like 1 and 2 separately.

3. Factorial:

Use recursion to multiply the number by the factorial of the number minus one.

Base case: factorial of 0 is 1.

4. Fibonacci Series:

Use recursion to sum the two preceding numbers.

Alternatively, use iteration to generate the series up to a limit.

5. Sum of Digits:

Use a loop to repeatedly extract the last digit using % 10 and add it to the sum.

Remove the last digit using integer division // 10.
